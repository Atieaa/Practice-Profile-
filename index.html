      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="bio">I am currently on a journey to transcend the limits of my capable engineering mind and to delve into the realms of coding. Predominantly working as a Mechanical Engineer has allowed me to become a broad thinker into learning many
        things in
        life as possible. I have achieved a Masters degree in Mechanical Engineering and have worked for a railway consulting company.... however now is the time for me to expand into the world of Full Stack Web Development and I cannot wait! </p>

      <h2>My Skills.</h2>

        <img class="cooperation" src="images\cooperation.png" alt="co-operation image">
        <h3>Co-operation</h3>
        <p class="Co-operation_description">Whether it's small projects or big projects, team members or managers, for the company or the collaboraters, for the staff or the public, throughout the years I have gained a substantial amount of
          experience regarding how to deal with
          different stakeholders and played as a vital role within the scenerio in ensuring the success of the finalised outcome. Delivering projects in a speedy manner yet making the customer happy is at the forefront of my goals and becoming a key
          team-player by co-operating with others is the way forward to achieve this.</p>

      <div class="skill-row">

        <h3>Attention To Detail</h3>
        <p>Sometimes tasks can be time consuming for me when i'm trying to perfect it as much as possible. As time consuming as it is, it enables me to reach my peak performance and allow to provide a unique asnwer/solution to a problem from which
          has not been sought out before. A classic example of this is during my engineering days as a Computer-Aided Designer (CAD), I always took more time to research into the various tools that a specific CAD software uses so that I could
          potentially cut my time by a great amount when completing a 2D/3D model, thereby delivering to our customers as efficiently as possible. This is no different to web development as any minor detail implemented can affect the UX of the
          individual. </p>

      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="Continuous-Effort" src="images\Continuous-Effort.png" alt="sign saying don't quit">
        <h3>Continuous-Effort</h3>
        <p>Yes I know I know, taken partially from a quote by Winston Churchill. As cheesy as it is, I live by this skill every single day of my life. The power to never give up heavily outweighs being super clever or super strong in my honest
          opinion. You must have heard of the phrase "practice makes perfect" right? well this is exactly the same thing! The idea that you keep trying something over and over again until it satisfies your goals, easily demonstrates your passion for
          that particular thing. I invest myself with continuous-effort in every thing I do; from making an outstanding cup of tea to delivering large scale projects!</p>
